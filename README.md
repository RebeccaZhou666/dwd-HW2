# About
New York is the city that never sleeps! We are fortunate to be a New Yorker and enjoy the endless events in New York. So I designed and built a event-sharing website this week.

# Prerequisites
A text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)- preferably VS Code to view code on your computer if you wish to download.

# Installation
For this particular project, there are no specific installation requirements. Download zip from Github or ```git clone <file-path>``` from command line. 

# Design

To design a event website, first of all, I need some contents.<br />
I found the contents from: [eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/d/ny--new-york/events/) & [ILoveNy](https://www.iloveny.com/)<br />
<br />
After analyzing the contents, I made a requirement for the website.


1. Contains all necessary info about a list events; Date, Name, Place, location, price, save event, share.
2. Featured events promotion
3. Nav bar: including logo, search bar, event menu that can be dropped down, sign in. 
4. Contain links to the detailed pages.
5. SEO: include title and description meta tags
6. Maintenance & Support: css is required to support Chrome and Safari.
7. Hosting: Souce code and design is open source, hosted on Github. Website is publicly accessible and deployed to Glitch.


Then I draw some sketches and transformed it to wireframing sketch.
